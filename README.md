<h1>My First Portfolio site</h1>

<h3>What is this project?</h3>
- I really wanted to build a landing page of sorts for myself, where i could also store some other projects for easy viewing. A portfolio site has meant i can display the key details about myself and showcase a 'digital resume', that i find personally much more engaging. For this project i really threw myself into the deep end, as this was the first time i had actively used jquery and other plugins for example. This has been ongoing as i have been busy with other projects for my classes! Now i still want to add some more shazam, so it's not finished... but it is very nearly there. I want to research and incorporate some more concepts and look more into carousels ðŸ’­

<h3>Why this project?</h3>
- As i was saying i really wanted to push myself, before diving in i had no real sense of a lot of the key development elements. Now, that's a different story! I'm confident enough now to apply my new skills and knowledge to my other projects.

<h3>Thanks</h3>
- Now, this would not have been possible without the great people out there who share their resources and skills. I am so appreciative for that knowledge, knowledge really is power and the more we share around the better. The amount of references would be insane as i have constantly been reading up on design and development for a few months, so that list might be a few miles long! But i want to say, thank you to all the content creators on youtube for providing visual and audio guidance. Thank you to all those on LinkedIn who share fabulous resources, engaging feedback, posts and advice. Thanks to the amazing documentation written by some top-notch coders out there, especially for the plugins! As this was my first rodeo, at first glimpse it really was a lot, but thanks to the great instructive guides you pulled me through. Additionally online resources through FCC, WW3S, CFG, Slackoverflow and so many more, truth be told if you've ever shared anything coding related.. it has helped someone out there! So thanks to all coders out there sharing and helping us navigate these first hurdles.
